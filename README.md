## Overview
### Description
Minimalistic productivity app that allows users to choose the most important of there tasks, and maintain it through "Task Pruning".

### App Evaluation
**Category**: Social Networking

**Mobile**: Mobile is the best form for this app due to constant movement of individuals, and task ideas coming in at random spots. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices.

**Story**: A zen like list system that relaxes the user, and helps the user ultra focus on their tasks to achieve a positive change.

**Market**: Any individual who has a goal in mind, and wants a simple list

**Habit**: We can add animations, and badges to reward constant logins, and goal achievements. We can also add reward points that can change the animations of achieving goals. We lastly add a social aspect later on such as friends.

**Scope**: V1 would just be a simple pruning task list that can be given to friends to try out themselves. 
V2 With these tests, we would refine the list and give it to a wider market, such as productivity feeds or groups. We would add the habit-forming features in this version. 
V3 we would finally upload it to the market, and have it as a real product.
